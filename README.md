 The objective of this case study is to provide a distinct example of market segmentation analysis using an alternative empirical dataset. For this scenario, consider the role of McDonald’s, seeking to identify consumer segments with differing perceptions of its brand. By understanding these systematic variations in brand image across segments, McDonald’s can make informed decisions about which groups to prioritize and how to tailor its messaging effectively.

The company may opt to strengthen and reinforce positive perceptions within segments that already view McDonald’s favorably. Conversely, it can focus on addressing segments with negative perceptions by identifying the core factors driving their dissatisfaction and implementing targeted modifications to improve their outlook. This analysis aims to strategically leverage insights into consumer behavior to optimize brand perception across diverse market segments.
